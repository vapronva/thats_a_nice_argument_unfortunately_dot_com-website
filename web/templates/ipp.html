							Information &amp; <strike>Frequently</strike> Asked Questions
						</h1>
						<h2 class="margin-small">
							Can I have that video on the background? And where did you get it?
						</h2>
						<p>
							Yes! You're welcome: <a href="https://peertube.vapronva.pw/w/7QQnoMUr9B8a2AiPV9coi4"
								target="_blank">peertube.vapronva.pw/w/7QQnoMUr9B8a2AiPV9coi4</a>. I recreated
							it one night frame by frame using KineMaster and Final Cut Pro.
						</p>
						<h2 class="margin-small">
							Do you really know my IP?
						</h2>
						<p>
							Yes, my friend. <strike>Your IP is {{ userIP }}, I&rsquo;m in your walls, run away.</strike>
						</p>
						<h2 class="margin-small">
							Where do you get all that information?
						</h2>
						<p>
							The combination of <a href="https://ipinfo.io" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"
								target="_blank">IPInfo</a> and <a href="https://proxycheck.io"
								rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ProxyCheck</a> with added nonsense by
							<a href="https://github.com/joke2k/faker" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"
								target="_blank">faker</a> and other custom lists of vendors.
						</p>
						<h2 class="margin-small">
							Which fields are fake?
						</h2>
						<p>
							Everything except: IP address, approximate location in longitude and latitude, WAN type.
							Yes, other stuff is completely random.
						</p>
						<h2 class="margin-small">
							Does it use traceroute or something similar?
						</h2>
						<p>
							Nope.
						</p>
						<h2 class="margin-small">
							What do you do behind the scenes?
						</h2>
						<p>
							Your request comes in, the IP is extracted, API gateway checks if the result was cached, the
							request is made to the DB to check whether the strings were already generated, up to two
							requests are made to the IPInfo and ProxyCheck, random information is generated based on
							time it'll take to display with faker and custom lists, the result is cached and the result
							is sent back to you. It's that simple!
						</p>
						<h2 class="margin-small">
							Can I use your API?
						</h2>
						<p>
							Probably, but why? Hit me on emai, if that&rsquo;s what you really want to!
